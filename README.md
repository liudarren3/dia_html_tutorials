# Dressed in Affirmations tutorial 

Hi, sorry I couldn't be here. I'm currently waiting to get onto a flight to San Diego.

How are you? (*awkward silence for about 3 seconds*) Nice. How was your week (list three things)? My week was great thanks for asking, although it could've been better. I like your outfit today, the colors match really well.

I'm a STEM major so my spelling is atrocious so forgive me if I mispll certin thngs. 

## Getting to the website
1st, let's get to the website
1. [Login](https://squareup.com/login?lang_code=en-us) into the square website
2. Input your information. I don't think you enabled two-factor authentication, but if you need a code or whatnot let the other teachers know and they can ping me
3. On the left-hand toolbar, click the 'Online' button and it will take you to 'Online' page. It make take some time so you might have to wait a bit
4. On the left-hand toolbar, click the 'Website' button and then 'Edit site' to get to your page 
    - If the website **does not look familiar** it is likely because you are on a different template. go back onto the Online page and click the 'Site' bar. You should be then able to choose from a series of different templates. Choose a different template and hit the 'Edit Site' button to get to the page you want.
5. You are now at the website editor! The elements of your website are shown on the left and the page itself is shown on the right. If you mouse over the left elements, the corresponding website elements will be highlighted in blue on the right.
