# Dressed in Affirmations tutorial 

Hi, sorry I couldn't be here. I'm currently waiting to get onto a flight to San Diego.

How are you? (*awkward silence for about 3 seconds*) Hmm I don't think I heard you. Could you say that again? (Please repeat what you just said) (*another 3 seconds of silence*) Nice. How was your week (list three things)? My week was great thanks for asking, although it could've been better. I like your outfit today, the colors match really well.

I'm a STEM major so my spelling is atrocious so forgive me if I mispll certin thngs. 

**One quick disclaimer:** Square is great and all for website design and it integrates online shopping really well. However, it doesn't really give you full control over everything that you would like to. There might be somethings that are either impossible or really hard to change and it's definitely not going to be your fault; Websites like these can be really annoying to navigate so keep that in mind.

## Getting to the website
1st, let's get to the website
1. [Login](https://squareup.com/login?lang_code=en-us) into the square website
2. Input your information. I don't think you enabled two-factor authentication, but if you need a code or whatnot let the other teachers know and they can ping me
3. On the left-hand toolbar, click the 'Online' button and it will take you to 'Online' page. It make take some time so you might have to wait a bit

4. On the left-hand toolbar, click the 'Website' button and then 'Edit site' to get to your page 
    - **Ignore this if your website looks familiar.** If the website **does not look familiar** it is likely because you are on a different template. go back onto the Online page and click the 'Site' bar. You should be then able to choose from a series of different templates. Choose a different template and hit the 'Edit Site' button to get to the page you want.
5. You are now at the website editor! The elements of your website are shown on the left and the page itself is shown on the right. If you mouse over the left elements, the corresponding website elements will be highlighted in blue on the right. **The order that the elements appear in can be changed by clicking and dragging the element up and down the toolbar**
## Your bio (AKA adding text and images together)

Let's start to get used to square. Let's make your biography first. Looking on your Canva website, the biography looks to be an image (on the left) next to some text on the right.

1. On the top left of the page, there should be a '+' sign next to a gear sign. Click on the plus and click 'Section' to add a new section. There should be a toolbar on the left

3. Recall that we want the image on the left and the text on the right. Scroll down until you hit the **Text and image** button and click it
4. This will give a little window that will give you different options for how you want to format the text and image. Click the one that you like the best.
5. Click the blue 'Add' button in the top left
6. From here we can actually start to edit the text. Click on the text and start typing to be able to edit the text. You will have some options to edit the style of the text on the left bar. You should play around with these. I do not think you will be able to change how the text wraps around or the general color of the text. 
7. If you don't want a Title, you can click the 'Title' button on the left and click the blue switch button.

8. To add an image, click the empty box. On the left, click the 'Add image' button. 
9. Click the 'Add files here or click to upload button' and upload the picture you would like. The image should now appear in the window
10. Click the image on the window and click the blue 'Done' button in the top right. The image should now appear!

Okay you have an idea of how to manipulate images and text. Similar things can be done if you choose the 'images' or 'Text' buttons when you add sections. Go crazy! Add all of the text and images that you want. 

# Typing with not the standard font

So you want to have several different types of text in our website, with things like 

Square has some pretty big limitations on the types of fonts it will allow you to use. The default font is very professional, but honestly kinda of boring in my opinion so here I'll teach you how to integrate your own fonts. Hopefully this is where the html tutorials will come in handy...

1st, we need to insert a code block into our website.
1. Like in the previous section: On the top left of the page, there should be a '+' sign next to a gear sign. Click on the plus and click 'Section' to add a new section. There should be a toolbar on the left
2. Scroll down and click the 'Embded code' block.

So here's a quick tutorial on fonts. Text can come in many different shapes and sizes, but we would like to be 

Let me know what worked for you! And what didn't work.
